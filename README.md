# Symbolic regression - Genetic Programming

Symbolic regression using Genetic Programming (GP) is a technique in machine learning where a symbolic equation or mathematical expression is evolved to fit a dataset. GP is a type of evolutionary algorithm inspired by natural selection and genetics, where a population of candidate solutions (expressions or equations in this case) evolves over generations through selection, mutation, and recombination to find the best solution.
